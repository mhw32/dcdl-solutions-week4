shorttrackspeedskating,"In short track speed skating, athletes compete not against the clock, but against each other. This introduces the elements of strategy, bravery and skill needed for racing.",How do athletes in short track speed skating compete against each other?,5,Athletes in short track speed skating compete against each other by racing around an oval track typically measuring 111.12 meters in circumference. They skate in a pack and try to outmaneuver each other to reach the finish line first.
shorttrackspeedskating,"North American Origin

Short track (or indoor) speed skating began in Canada and the United States of America, where they held mass-start competitions on an oval track as early as 1905-1906. The lack of 400m long tracks led many North American skaters to practice on ice rinks. However, practicing on a smaller track brought new challenges, like tighter turns and shorter straightaways, which lead to different techniques in order to win on a shorter track. These countries began competing against each other on an annual basis. The sport’s rise in popularity was partly thanks to the North American racing rules, which introduced a “pack” style of racing. Capitalising on this, the organisers of the 1932 Lake Placid Games, with the consent of the International Skating Union (ISU), agreed to follow these rules for the programme’s speed skating events.",What contributed to the rise in popularity of short track speed skating in North America?,5,"The rise in popularity of short track speed skating in North America can be attributed to increased media coverage of the sport, the success of American and Canadian athletes in international competitions, as well as more opportunities for young athletes to participate in the sport at local levels. Additionally, the excitement and fast-paced nature of short track speed skating may have also contributed to its popularity."
shorttrackspeedskating,"International Recognition

Countries such as Great Britain, Australia, Belgium, France and Japan deserve a great deal of credit in the development of the sport, since they participated in international open competitions before the sport was recognized by the International Skating Union. In 1967, the ISU declared Short Track Speed Skating an official sport, but international worldwide competitions were not held until 1976. During this period of time, countries kept competing amongst themselves.",What countries played a key role in the development of Short Track Speed Skating before it was officially recognized by the International Skating Union in 1967?,4,"South Korea, Canada, and the United States."

After having been a demonstration sport at the 1988 Games in Calgary, short track speed skating became part of the Olympic programme in Albertville in 1992, with two individual events and two relays. The discipline comprises men’s and women’s events. Since the 2006 Olympic Games in Turin, the programme of this discipline has included eight events.

It quickly became popular with the public, who are thrilled to watch rapid races on tight tracks. The skaters race so closely to each other that collisions and falls are inevitable, which is why the walls of the speed skating oval are padded.",When did short track speed skating become a part of the Olympic programme and how many events were initially included?,5,"Short track speed skating became a part of the Olympic programme in 1992, during the Albertville Winter Olympics. Initially, there were four events included: men's 1000m, men's 500m, women's 1000m, and women's 500m."

sportclimbing,"Sport climbing is a modern sport that has become immensely popular over the past 20 years. It is a young, mixed-gender sport – with 39 per cent of climbers under 18 years old – practised both outdoors and in a more urban format indoors. There are over 25 million climbers in 150 countries all over the world.

In 1985, a group of climbers gathered in Bardonecchia, near Turin, Italy, for an event called “SportRoccia”, which became the first organised lead competition in which competitors climb within a certain time limit. One year later, the first competition event on an artificial climbing wall was organised in Vaulx-en-Velin near Lyon, France.",When and where was the first organised lead competition in sport climbing held?,4,"The first organized lead competition in sport climbing was held in Bardonecchia, Italy in 1985."
sportclimbing,"Brief Overview of the Rules

At the Olympics, sport climbing involves three formats : bouldering, speed and lead. In bouldering, athletes climb 4.5 m high walls without ropes, in a limited period of time and in the fewest attempts possible. Speed is a spectacular race against the clock in one-on-one elimination rounds that combine precision and explosivity. The best athletes scale a 15m high and five degrees inclinated wall in under six seconds for men and under seven seconds for women.

In the lead event, athletes climb as high as they can on a wall over 15m high in six minutes without having seen the route ahead of time. The routes for this event are more and more complex and challenging during the event, requiring all of the athletes’ physical and mental ability.

In Tokyo, each athlete competed in all three disciplines and the final scores reflected the combined results of the three competitions. The climber with the lowest score took home the first Olympic gold medal in the history of sport climbing.

In Paris 2024, two competitions will crown their own olympic champion in sport climbing. One will be a combined competition of bouldering and lead events, and the second one will only feature a speed event.",What format of sport climbing will be featured in the second competition at the Paris 2024 Olympics?,5,Speed climbing

taekwondo,"Brief Overview of the Rules

The aim of taekwondo is for an athlete to kick and punch their opponent while avoiding being struck themselves. The trademark of this martial art is its combination of kicking and punching movements in quick succession. Matches are fought on an octagonal mat for three rounds of two minutes each. Points are awarded according to the degree of difficulty of techniques used; for example, a kick to the head scores higher than punches and kicks to the trunk. Spinning kicks are also rewarded with extra points. Penalties may be given to athletes for various faults.",How are points awarded in taekwondo matches?,5,Points in taekwondo matches are awarded when a competitor successfully lands a kick or punch on their opponent's scoring zone with enough force and precision to register on electronic sensors.

coastalrowing,"What are the rules of Coastal Rowing?

Beach sprint rowing races are usually 600m in total length. They begin on dry land, with an athlete from each team running 50m down a beach and into the water, where they enter their sculling boat. Each rower has two oars, and they row 250m straight towards a buoy anchored in the water. The athletes then row around the buoy to turn 180 degrees and continue the 250m back towards the shore, where they jump out of the boat, run up the beach and cross the finish line. The quickest team wins, and races are often held as head-to-head elimination contests. For pairs and quads competitions, a ‘runner’ is designated, who is the only athlete to start and end the race on the beach, and is often an expert at diving for the line.",What is the length of a typical beach sprint rowing race in Coastal Rowing?,5,The typical length of a beach sprint rowing race in Coastal Rowing is approximately 350 meters.

artisticswimming,"Brief Overview of the Rules

At the Olympic Games, the sport consists of two events: a duet and a team competition. The duet events consist of a technical routine and a free routine. An acrobatic routine is added for the team event. The events will take place on a 30 metres by 20 metres area and in a pool with a depth of 3 metres minimum.

The routines are scored by judges who take several criteria into account: level of difficulty, synchronization, execution and artistic impression.

Athletes need to propel themselves out of the water to perform certain movements or pivot with the upper half of their bodies underwater. The sport therefore requires great flexibility, power, attention to detail, and coordination.",What are the criteria judges take into account when scoring synchronized swimming routines at the Olympic Games?,5,"Judges take into account factors such as synchronization, difficulty of movements, artistic impression, choreography, technical execution, and overall presentation when scoring synchronized swimming routines at the Olympic Games."

cricket,"Cricket is a bat-and-ball team sport where the batting side tries to score as many runs as possible while the bowling side attempts to get batters out, also known as taking wickets, and restrict the flow or runs.

Cricket bats are constructed from high-grade willow with balls made of leather stitched onto a cork core.

International cricket was solely comprised of Test matches comprising two innings per team, but limited overs formats have largely taken over in recent decades with Twenty20 - 20 overs per side - it is the suggested format to be played at the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games.",What material are cricket bats made from and what are cricket balls made of?,5,"Cricket bats are typically made from willow wood, specifically English willow or Kashmir willow. Cricket balls are typically made from a core of cork, which is wrapped in string and covered with a leather casing."
cricket,"By whom, where and when was Cricket invented?

Cricket was first played in southern England in the 16th century but it was not until 1744 that the 'Laws of Cricket' were codified with the first recorded women's match taking place a year later.

Limited overs cricket, where teams have a set number of overs to post a score, was founded in India in 1951 with the first-one-day international (ODI) held in 1971.

While ODIs have gradually been shortened, to satisfy timing and television demands, to 50 overs a side, Twenty20 cricket (or T20) was created in 2003 by the England and Wales Cricket Board.

T20 internationals were first held the following year and, thanks to innovations like the Indian Premier League (IPL), 20-over-a-side cricket has become its most popular format with numerous leagues attracting top players from across the world.",When were the 'Laws of Cricket' codified?,5,The 'Laws of Cricket' were codified in 1744.
cricket,"What are the rules of Cricket?

Each team has 11 players with one side batting and the other fielding. The fielding side has at least five bowlers who bowl (throwing with a straight arm unlike a baseball pitcher's bent arm) at one of a pair of batters on a pitch 22 yards (20 metres) away. The batter guards a set of three wooden stumps in the ground - with two bails on top - and the wicketkeeper from the fielding side stands behind them.

A batter scores runs by hitting the ball and running to the other end of the pitch with their partner going in the opposite direction. If they score an odd number of runs, their partner faces the next ball. A batter scores four runs for hitting the ball to the boundary, and six runs should the ball clear the boundary rope without touching the ground. A bowler bowls an over - six balls in succession - before another bowler begins the next over from the other end of the pitch.

The main ways in which a batter can be out (dismissed) are bowled (if the bails are dislodged by the ball), caught, leg before wicket (if the ball hits the batter's pads in front of the stumps) and run out (bails removed by a member of the fielding side with the ball before the batter completes a run).

If a team loses 10 wickets, leaving one batter on their own, they are 'all out' and the innings is over. In T20, the innings is usually complete at the end of 20 overs. The team batting second must then try to exceed that score inside 20 overs and without losing all 10 wickets.

In the Laws of Cricket, the only difference between the men's and women's games is the use of a slightly smaller and lighter ball in the latter.",What are the main ways in which a batter can be out in the game of Cricket?,5,"A batter can be out in Cricket through the following main ways: bowled, caught, LBW (Leg Before Wicket), run out, stumped, and hit wicket."

archery,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Targets are 122cm in diameter and positioned 70m away from the archers, who must shoot their arrows as close to the centre of the target as possible in order to beat their opponents. Olympic archery comprises five events: two individual competitions for men and women, two team competitions (one each for men and women), and a mixed team competition, which returns to the programme after making its Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020.

Archery requires great concentration and dexterity; archers must overcome their nerves as a single mistake can prove costly in competition. Individual competitions at the Games begin with the ranking round, where each of the 64 archers shoot 72 arrows to determine their ranking for the single-elimination bracket. The athletes compete in this knockout system until the final according to their ranking, with the top‑ranked archer facing off against the 64th‑ranked archer, the second‑ranked against the 63rd‑ranked, and so on.

The team event uses the same ranking results from the individual competition to determine seeding for the teams; the top four teams receive a bye into the quarterfinals, while the rest of the field competes in a single-elimination bracket.

athletics,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Modern athletics is composed of various running, jumping, throwing, walking, and combined events. Due to its many categories and disciplines, athletics involves the most participants in a single sport at the Olympic Games.

The track programme includes sprints, middle-distance and long-distance events as well as hurdles, steeplechase races, and relays for men and women. These events take place on the 400m oval track in the Olympic stadium (made up of two straights and two curved bends).

Two kinds of events are held on public roads —the marathon and race walking—which are both incredibly demanding and highly tactical, often leading to a variety of strategies with athletes sometimes even working together to defeat a rival. Spectators line the route to watch and cheer the athletes on.

The Olympic programme also includes two combined events—the seven-event women’s heptathlon and the ten-event men’s decathlon—both of which are contested over two days. Both competitions test athletes’ abilities across a range of athletic disciplines, with the most well-rounded competitor earning the gold medal. The disciplines are contested on, within, and around the track in the Olympic stadium, in the jumping area (high jump and pole vault), the jumping pit (long jump and triple jump), the throwing circle (shot put, discus and hammer throw), and the javelin runway.

fencing,"Brief Overview of the Rules

In fencing, two competitors, each holding a weapon in one hand, face each other to strike their opponent on a valid target area of the body. The rules differ according to the type of weapon used. There are 12 events in Olympic fencing, with three types of weapon used: foil, épée and sabre.

Hits made with the point (tip), edge, or back of the blade are counted as valid in sabre, with the target area including the entire torso above the waist, as well as the head and arms. In épée and foil, fencers only score when they strike their opponent with the point of their weapon. In épée the target area covers the entire body from the mask down to the feet, while in foil the target area is the trunk only (torso, shoulders and neck).

There are three Olympic shooting disciplines: rifle, pistol and shotgun. Rifle and pistol events take place on shooting ranges, where athletes aim at targets at distances of 10m, 25m and 50m. There are also three positions: kneeling (where the athlete goes down on one knee and rests the elbow on the other knee), prone and standing. Some events include all positions.

To hit the targets as accurately and as close to the centre (the bullseye) as possible, marksmen use relaxation techniques to lower their heartbeat. Shotgun events are different in principle, as they take place outdoors. Marksmen shoot at flying targets fired from different angles and directions. This sport demands a great deal of concentration, decision making and sharp reflexes.",What are the three positions used in rifle and pistol shooting events at the Olympics?,5,"The three positions used in rifle and pistol shooting events at the Olympics are prone, standing, and kneeling."

artisticgymnastics,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Artistic gymnastics is composed of a number of individual competitions on different apparatus, as well as a team competition involving gender-specific apparatus. Each piece of apparatus requires different skills. Men compete across the floor exercise, pommel horse, rings, vault, parallel bars, and horizontal bar, while women’s events include the vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise. Each element of gymnastic competition requires strength, agility, coordination, and precision.

Up until 2004, gymnastic routines at the Games were evaluated with a maximum of 10 points, but from 2005 the mode of scoring changed to a combination of a D score (difficulty/content of the exercise) and an E score (execution) to allow for a greater variation between athletes’ performances.

Changes to the scoring system were first considered following the Montreal 1976 Olympic Games, when Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci became the first competitor in history to earn a perfect score of 10.0 for her routine on the uneven bars during the team competition.",What two components make up the scoring system in artistic gymnastics since 2005?,5,The two components that make up the scoring system in artistic gymnastics since 2005 are the Difficulty Score (D-score) and the Execution Score (E-score).

karate,"What are the different types of Karate? What are the rules of Karate?

Karate comprises two modalities: Kumite and Kata. In Kumite, or combat, the winner of the three-minute fights is the one who obtains a clear lead of eight points, or the competitor having the highest number of points at time-up. If the fight is a draw, then the winner is determined by the first unopposed point advantage (Senshu) or in the case of a scoreless result, by a majority decision of the judges (Hantei).

Points are scored according to correctly-executed techniques of controlled punches, strikes and kicks.

One point – “Yuko” – is awarded for delivering a punch with a closed hand (tsuki) to the head, neck, belly, side, back or torso of the opponent.

Two points – “Waza-ari” – are awarded for a kick to the body.

Three points – “Ippon” – are scored for a high kick delivered to the head, or for a punch delivered on an opponent who has been taken to the ground after a sweep or takedown.

In Kata (meaning ""form""), competitors execute a set of pre-approved choreographed movements, with the winner being declared by a pool of judges using an electronic voting system.

Karateka are evaluated according to technical and athletic performances.",What are the different scoring rules in Kumite (combat) in Karate?,5,"In Kumite (combat) in Karate, the different scoring rules include techniques such as clean and controlled punches, kicks, and strikes to the opponent's head, torso, and sides.

rowing,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Rowing involves propelling a boat using oars fixed to the vessel. It differs from other disciplines in that rowers sit with their backs to the direction of movement, therefore crossing the finish line backwards.

Rowers compete across a distance of 2,000 metres, alone or in teams of 2, 4 or 8. There are two different disciplines: double scull and sweep rowing. In sweep events, rowers hold a single oar with both hands, while in sculling they hold one oar in each hand. The eight-person crews have a coxswain, who steers the boat and directs the crew. The boat is steered using a small rudder that is attached to the foot of one of the rowers by a cable. There are two lightweight rowing events.",What is the difference between sweep rowing and sculling in the sport of rowing?,5,"In sweep rowing, each rower has one oar, with one rower controlling both sides of the boat.

equestrian,"Equestrian events originated in Ancient Greece, where it was thought that a perfect partnership was needed if rider and horse were to survive in battle. Dressage was therefore developed as a way of training horses for war. Equestrian events appeared at the ancient Olympic Games as chariot racing, which was a daring and exciting spectacle. The art of riding then fell into oblivion until its revival during the Renaissance. Dressage reached its peak with the creation of the world-famous Spanish Riding School in Vienna in 1729, which established the foundations of the modern discipline.",What was the significance of the Spanish Riding School in the development of dressage as a modern discipline?,5,"The Spanish Riding School played a crucial role in the development of dressage as a modern discipline by preserving and promoting classical dressage principles, techniques, and traditions. The school, based in Vienna, Austria, has been influential in shaping the standardized movements, training methods, and overall standards of dressage. Riders and horses trained at the Spanish Riding School have contributed to the advancement and recognition of dressage as a refined and artful equestrian sport."
equestrian,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Equestrian comprises three disciplines at the Games, with men and women competing on equal terms.

In the jumping discipline, riders and horses are timed as they jump over obstacles, with time penalties imposed for each obstacle toppled. Agility, technique and harmony between horse and rider are essential.

Dressage is the most advanced form of horse training, where horse and rider perform a series of artistic movements to music. Judges evaluate the ease and fluidity with which they move around the course.

The third discipline of eventing resembles an equestrian triathlon. It combines the two other events—jumping and dressage—with a third: cross-country, which consists of a long course combining solid and natural obstacles, drawing on the athletes’ endurance and experience. The horse and rider with the most versatile skills win the three events.",How are time penalties calculated in the jumping discipline of equestrian at the Games?,5,"Time penalties in the jumping discipline of equestrian at the Games are typically calculated by adding penalties for any faults or refusals during the course to the rider's time. For example, knocking a rail down might result in 4 penalties added to the rider's time. The rider with the lowest total time penalties is the winner."

cyclingroad,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Road cycling takes place outside and is divided into two kinds of events at the Olympic Games: the road race and the individual time trial.

The road race, in which all riders set off at the same time in a mass start, is a highly tactical feat of endurance. The race (over 120km and 200km for female and male athletes respectively) is often won in a sprint finish over a few hundred metres, which means riders need to position themselves perfectly and conserve their energy in the first part of the race.

The time trial is a solo effort in which competitors set off at staggered times rather than in a grouped peloton. They cover a much shorter distance than that of the road race, as the time trial rarely exceeds 50km. Both events require consistency, concentration, and preservation through effective aerodynamic positioning and power.",What are the two kinds of road cycling events at the Olympic Games?,5,The two kinds of road cycling events at the Olympic Games are the road race and the individual time trial.

Volleyball is played by two teams of six players on an indoor court 18m long and 9m wide. Matches are played to the best of five sets. A point is scored when the ball lands within the court boundaries or when a playing error is made. The first team to score 25 points by a two-point margin wins the set, with each match following a best-of-five sets format. If required, a fifth set is played to 15 points (a winning margin of two points is still required). 

In a game of volleyball, the ball can reach speeds of up to 130km/h, particularly following a spectacular jump serve or smash. Athletes therefore require great strength and lightning-fast reflexes to block them.",How many players are typically on each volleyball team and what are the dimensions of the indoor court they play on?,5,There are typically 6 players on each volleyball team.

The Olympic weightlifting programme has greatly evolved over time. Since the Montreal 1976 Games, there have been two lifts used in competition: the snatch and the clean and jerk. In the snatch, the bar is lifted from the floor to above the head in one movement. By contrast, the clean and jerk is a two-stage action: the bar is first brought up to the shoulders before being jerked over the head. These extremely demanding exercises require exceptional physical strength and ironclad mental resolve.

Today, competitors perform both lifts three times, and their best result in each lift are combined to determine their overall score. The competitor with the highest total score is declared the winner. Men and women will each compete across five weight classes for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.",How are the winners determined in Olympic weightlifting competitions?,5,The winners in Olympic weightlifting competitions are determined based on the total weight lifted by the athletes in two main lifts: the snatch and the clean and jerk.

trampolinegymnastics,"Trampolining was invented in 1934 by American gymnast George Nissen who, after watching trapeze acrobats perform tricks while bouncing off safety nets, built the first prototype trampoline to recreate their acrobatics. Initially used as a piece of equipment to train astronauts and athletes training for other acrobatic sports, the trampoline quickly became immensely popular as a sport in its own right. The first trampoline world championships were organised in London in 1964, and the sport joined the International Gymnastics Federation 34 years later in 1998.",Who invented trampolining and when?,5,The modern trampoline was invented by George Nissen and Larry Griswold in 1936.
trampolinegymnastics,"Brief Overview of the Rules

The two individual trampoline events (men’s and women’s) involve athletes bouncing over 8 metres high in the air on a trampoline, which is a rectangular canvas made of synthetic fabric, to perform a series of twists, bounces and somersaults.

The trampoline bed is attached to a frame with steel springs so that its recoil action propels athletes high into the air. During competition, athletes perform routines composed of ten elements, scored according to their difficulty, execution and time spent in the air. The sport is highly technical and requires absolute precision.",How is scoring determined in individual trampoline events based on the provided context?,5,"Scoring in individual trampoline events is determined based on the difficulty and execution of the routine performed by the gymnast. Judges assign points for each element of the routine, including jumps, twists, and flips, as well as deductions for any mistakes or technical errors. The total score is calculated by adding up the points earned for each element and deducting any penalties, resulting in a final score for the performance."

waterpolo,"Water polo was initially a dangerous sport that first developed in the rivers and lakes of mid-19th century England as an aquatic version of rugby. In 1870, the London Swimming Association developed rules for the sport to be used in indoor swimming pools. Later rules that developed in Scotland emphasized a football style of play as opposed to the “rugby variant.” Water polo was introduced to the USA in 1888, where the rugby style of play—similar to the sport of American football—was used in the water. However, the rest of the world adopted the Scottish rules of the sport, which formed the basis for the sport of water polo as we know it today. The first international match took place in 1890 between England and Scotland (Scotland won 4-0).","What were the two main styles of play that developed in the early history of water polo, and which one ultimately became the basis for the modern sport?",5,"The two main styles of play that developed in the early history of water polo were the Scottish ""football in the water"" style and the English ""swimming in the water"" style. It was the Scottish style, with its rough and physical play, that ultimately became the basis for the modern sport of water polo."
waterpolo,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Two teams of seven players face off in a 3m deep pool, the dimensions of which are not fixed and can vary between 20×10 and 30×20 meters. World Aquatics-approved matches require a 30x20 meter pool for men and a 25x20 meter pool for women. Matches consist of four eight-minute quarters. Other than the goalkeeper, players may only hold the ball with one hand. Possession lasts 30 seconds; if the team does not attempt a shot within that time, possession passes to the opposition and the shot clock is reset.

Water polo is an intensely physical sport; contact is permitted with players possessing the ball. Strength, endurance, power and strategy are therefore essential.",What are the dimensions of the pool required for World Aquatics-approved water polo matches for men and women?,5,"The dimensions for a World Aquatics-approved water polo pool for men are 30 meters x 20 meters, with a minimum depth of 2 meters. For women, the dimensions are slightly smaller at 25 meters x 17 meters, with the same minimum depth of 2 meters."
waterpolo,"Olympic History

Water polo is one of the oldest team sports at the modern Olympic Games, as it was added to the programme at the same time as rugby in 1900 – first in the form of competitions between clubs, then tournaments between countries from 1908. However, it wasn’t until Sydney 2000, a century later, that the women’s competition was introduced at the Olympic Games.

European National Olympic Committees have been the dominant force in men’s water polo for years, with an NOC from the continent winning gold at every edition of the Games since 1908. Hungary tops the men’s medal table with 16 medals (including nine golds). Women’s water polo at the Olympics is still in its infancy, but the USA are the reigning three-time champions after winning gold at London 2012, Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020.",When was women's water polo introduced to the Olympic Games?,5,Women's water polo was introduced to the Olympic Games in the year 2000 during the Sydney Olympics.

In 1924 in Chamonix, an ancient form of biathlon made its Olympic debut: the military patrol. This event was then in demonstration in 1928, 1936 and 1948. After some attempts to incorporate it into a winter pentathlon, biathlon appeared at the Games in its current form in 1960 in Squaw Valley. Women’s biathlon made its first appearance on the Olympic programme in Albertville in 1992.

Until the 1976 Games in Innsbruck, the events comprised an individual race and a relay. In Lake Placid in 1980, a second individual event was introduced.

In Salt Lake City in 2002, a 12.5km pursuit event was added for men and 10km for women. From Turin in 2006, a new mass-start event was introduced for both men and women.

tennis,"The precursor to tennis was the “jeu de paume,” or “game of the hand,” which originated in France in the 11th century. It was played in a monastery courtyard and involved using one's palm to hit a ball against walls and sloping roofs. Tennis, as we know it today, was developed in 19th-century England. As the sport’s soaring popularity overtook that of croquet, the All England Croquet Club decided to allow its lawns to be used for tennis. Several national federations were set up throughout the world during the 19th century, culminating in the birth of the International Lawn Tennis Federation—now known as the International Tennis Federation—in 1913.",What was the precursor to tennis and where did it originate?,5,"The precursor to tennis was most likely real tennis, also known as court tennis, and it originated in France."

Tennis has been contested in sporadic fashion throughout Olympic Games history. It first featured at the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896, but was withdrawn from the programme after the 1924 Olympic Games due to disputes between the International Lawn Tennis Federation and the International Olympic Committee over how to define amateur players. Despite a return as a demonstration event at Mexico 1968 and Los Angeles 1984, tennis did not make a definitive comeback as a full medal sport at the Olympic Games before Seoul 1988. Since then, some of the world’s greatest tennis players have competed at each edition of the Games. In recent years, the gold medal has been taken home by several superstars, including Rafael Nadal, Olympic champion in the singles event in 2008 and doubles in 2016; Stan Wawrinka and Roger Federer, Olympic doubles champions in 2008; and Serena and Venus Williams, who have won eight Olympic titles between them.",When did tennis return as a full medal sport at the Olympic Games after being withdrawn in 1924?,5,Tennis returned as a full medal sport at the Olympic Games in 1988.
marathonswimming,"At the first three editions of the modern Olympic Games, all swimming events took place in a natural body of water prior to the inclusion of pools at the Games in 1908. Marathon swimming reappeared in 1991 when the discipline was officially introduced at the FINA World Swimming Championships (now known as the World Aquatics Championships); at the time, events were held over 25km and took over five hours to complete.

marathonswimming,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Marathon swimming takes places in open water environments such as the sea, rivers and lakes. Athletes must complete a 10km course, which takes nearly two hours to complete; their endurance, physical strength and brain power are all put to the test.

An ability to adapt is also crucial; tides and currents change quickly at sea, and the athletes must consider this in their strategy. Using the right tactics for the course and conditions is therefore key. In the last 3km, swimmers begin to make their move for the finish line—how they manage their efforts becomes essential and is what ultimately influences the end result.","What distance must athletes complete in a marathon swimming event, and what factors must they consider in order to be successful in this challenging sport?",5,"Athletes must complete a distance of 10 kilometers in a marathon swimming event. In order to be successful in this challenging sport, athletes must consider factors such as proper pacing, nutrition and hydration throughout the race, weather conditions, currents, navigation, and mental toughness. They also need to train extensively to build endurance and strength, as well as practice open water swimming techniques."
marathonswimming,"Olympic History

Marathon swimming became the latest swimming discipline to be added to the Olympic programme when the 10km race was introduced at the Beijing Games in 2008. The short history of this discipline means that few National Olympic Committees and athletes have had a chance to stand out in marathon swimming.

Although certain athletes focus solely on marathon swimming, others were previously specialists in other freestyle pool events, making these swimmers highly competitive. A prime example is Tunisian swimmer Oussama Mellouli, who won the gold medal in the men’s 1,500m freestyle event in Beijing in 2008 and then won the men’s marathon swimming event in London four years later.",When was marathon swimming first added to the Olympic programme?,4,Marathon swimming was first added to the Olympic programme in 2008 at the Beijing Olympics.
football,"Although football can trace its roots back to Ancient China, the modern version of the game was born on the streets of medieval England, before going on to become the most popular sport in the world.

The (very) early games of football in medieval England involved a large mass of people who would attempt to drag a pig’s bladder—by any means possible—to markers at opposing ends of a town. Such events were well known for being as violent as they were popular. In the 16th century, English schools established the modern football codes, thereby transforming what were mob riots into a proper sport.",What is the origin of the modern version of football?,5,The modern version of football originated in England in the 19th century.

There are two Olympic wrestling disciplines, each with its own rules. In Greco-Roman wrestling, a competitor can only use his arms and upper body to attack his opponent above the waist. Freestyle wrestling is a much more open form of the sport in which competitors also use their legs and can hold opponents above or below the waist.

However, the objective is the same in both styles. Contested on a circular combat area, a bout consists of two three-minute periods. Wrestlers must either use their bare hands to pin their opponent’s two shoulders down to the mat without holding them by their singlet (this is called a ‘fall’) or, if no fall is secured during the bout, have the most points at the end of regulation time by performing takedown and reversal moves.",What are the differences between Greco-Roman wrestling and freestyle wrestling in terms of rules and techniques?,5,"In Greco-Roman wrestling, wrestlers are only allowed to use their upper bodies and arms to attack and defend, while in freestyle wrestling, wrestlers can use both their upper and lower bodies. Additionally, in Greco-Roman wrestling, wrestlers are not allowed to attack the opponent's legs, while in freestyle wrestling, attacks to the legs are permitted. Techniques such as suplexes or gut wrenches are more commonly seen in Greco-Roman wrestling, while freestyle wrestling includes a wider variety of takedowns and techniques."

It combines elements of traditional dance and artistic gymnastics, making use of four apparatus: ribbon, hoop, ball and clubs. The music played during gymnasts’ performances also plays a significant role and music with vocals is allowed. Rhythmic gymnastics is a women‑only discipline.

In the individual events, gymnasts perform four times, using each piece of apparatus once. Each performance must be 75 to 90 seconds long. The group event sees a team of five gymnasts from the same National Olympic Committee performing twice. In the first routine, the gymnasts must all use the same apparatus, and in the second they use a mixed selection.

They need to be warmed up before a match because the rubber material becomes more bouncy and responsive when it is warm, allowing for better play and performance during the match."
squash,"By whom, where and when was Squash invented?

Squash was derived from the game of racquets - itself a descendant of tennis - played in the 18th century in London prisons where players hit balls with rackets against a wall or in a corner to bring a sidewall into operation.

In the mid-19th century, following the advent of the vulcanisation of rubber, students at English boys’ boarding school Harrow replaced the hard racquets ball with a larger, hollow rubber ball which travelled slower.

Originally called 'baby racquets', a Harrow School election resulted in the name change to squash with graduates starting the spread of the sport beyond its public school origins.",How was the game of squash developed from the game of racquets?,5,"The game of squash was developed from the game of racquets by players in a debtor's prison who modified the game to be played in a smaller, more enclosed space. This led to the creation of the fast-paced, high-intensity sport we now know as squash."
squash,"What are the rules of Squash?

On the front wall of a squash court, there are three lines - the tin 43cm off the ground, the service line at a height of 1.78m, and the out line at 4.57m which slopes down on the side walls to 2.13m on the back wall.

At the start of a point, the server must serve from one of the two service boxes on the floor and strike the ball between the service line and the out line.

After that, all subsequent shots can be struck off any wall provided it hits the front wall between the tin and the out line before hitting the ground. The ball is only permitted to bounce once on the floor.

The winner of a rally receives a point and the next serve. The first player to 11 points - by two clear points - wins a game. The first player to three games takes the match.",What are the key lines on a squash court and what are the rules regarding where the ball must be struck during a serve?,5,"The key lines on a squash court are the out-of-bounds lines and the service box lines.

flagfootball,"What are the rules of Flag Football?

There are five players on each team on the field drawn from 12-person squads. Players tend to specialise in either offence or defence and matches consist of two 20-minute halves.

A flag football pitch measures 70 x 30 yards (64m x 27.4m) with 10 yards (9.1m) allotted to each of the two endzones.

Play starts at the team's own five-yard line with the centre snapping the ball back to the quarterback who either passes the ball forward to try and find a receiver, or hands off to a running back.

The play is over when either a flag is removed, the ball-carrier goes out of bounds, or a forward pass hits the ground.

The team on offence has four attempts - known as downs - to go from their own five-yard line to halfway. If successful, they have another four downs to reach the endzone and score a touchdown. If unsuccessful on either count, the ball is turned over to the opposition who start on their own five-yard line.

After a touchdown, worth six points, teams go for an extra point - by running or passing - from the five-yard line, or two extra points from the 10-yard line.

If the scores are tied after 40 minutes, sudden-death overtime begins with the first team to score taking victory.",How many players are on each team in a game of flag football?,5,"Usually, there are 7 players on each team in a game of flag football."

judo,"Judo is a traditional Japanese martial art derived from jiu-jitsu, the hand-to-hand combat technique of ancient samurai warriors. Dr Jigoro Kano is credited for founding the discipline in Tokyo after opening his first dojo (school), the kōdōkan, in 1882. In Japanese, the word “judo” means “the gentle way,” but the traditional wrestling sport can hardly be described as such—it requires considerable physical effort. Dr. Kano combined the philosophical principles of judo with physical, intellectual and moral education methods while simultaneously eliminating many of the more dangerous aspects of jiu-jitsu.

judo,"Brief Overview of the Rules

The objective of judo is to throw your opponent to the ground, immobilise them with a pinning hold or force them into submission with a joint lock or choke. There are two types of scores in judo:

An ippon is awarded when an athlete throws his opponent to the mat on his or her back with strength, speed and control. An ippon can also be awarded through submission or by pinning an opponent to the ground for 20 seconds. If a judoka achieves ippon, they immediately win the match.

A waza-ari is awarded for a throw that isn’t clear enough to be an ippon (either because it lacked speed or force, or the opponent did not land primarily on their back) or when an   opponent is pinned down for less than 20 seconds (but longer than 10 seconds). Two waza‑ari in one match is the equivalent of an ippon and immediately ends the match.

Judo competitions are divided into weight classes for both genders, with a match lasting four minutes (the match enters overtime in the event of a tied score after four minutes). Penalties are awarded for passiveness during matches or behaviour deemed contrary to the spirit of judo.",What is the criteria for awarding an ippon in a judo match?,5,"An ippon is awarded in a judo match when a contestant executes a throw that lands the opponent on their back with speed and force, or a pin that lasts for 20 seconds. Other criteria for awarding an ippon include a submission hold that forces the opponent to tap out or an act of instant defeat by the opponent, such as a serious injury or disqualification."

Judo made its Olympic debut at Tokyo 1964, and has been a permanent fixture of the Olympic programme since the 1972 Games in Munich. The women's competition was introduced at the Olympics in 1988 as a demonstration sport, though it became an official medal event just four years later at the Barcelona 1992 Olympic Games.

Since its introduction to the Olympic Games, judo's popularity has flourished worldwide, with 128 National Olympic Committees competing in the judo competition at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.

Baseball is typically played on a larger field with nine players on each team, while softball is played on a smaller field with 10 players on each team. Both sports are popular in the United States and around the world."
baseballsoftball,"What's the difference between Baseball and Softball?

While there are world championships for both men and women in both sports, at the Olympic level baseball has been a men's-only sport while softball has been a women's-only sport. There are differences in the number of players on each team between the two sports, the size of the field, and in some rules.

Softball pitchers are also required to throw underhand, and most pitchers throw using the windmill pitch style, where the ball is thrown after rotating in a large circle. In softball, top female pitchers can reach speeds of over 100km/h. That speed fits with the fast-paced nature of the game. Since the bases aren’t as far apart, there is a shorter pitching distance. The game is also shorter in duration to baseball, with only seven innings compared to baseball’s nine.",What is one key difference between softball and baseball in terms of pitching style and speed?,5,"One key difference between softball and baseball in terms of pitching style and speed is that softball pitchers typically pitch underhand using a windmill motion, while baseball pitchers pitch overhand. In general, softball pitches tend to be slower than baseball pitches due to the underhand motion and shorter distance between the pitcher's mound and home plate in softball."
baseballsoftball,"By whom, where and when was Baseball/Softball invented?

The earliest record of the game of ""baseball"" being played was in Surrey, England, in 1749. The sport made it to the United States by the 1770s, and the first organised professional league—the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players—was founded in 1875. Baseball is considered ""America's past-time"".

Softball was first imagined as “indoor baseball” in 1887 in Chicago, Illinois, by reporter George Hancock after watching someone hit a boxing glove with a broom handle. He went on to publish rules for the game and later took it outside, playing on fields too small for baseball. While the rules remained vague, interest in the game grew, and more than 100 area high school teams were formed by 1892.

In 1895, firefighters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, played a similar game named “kitten ball” using a ball of yarn wrapped in leather. In 1907, a guide for indoor baseball published by Albert Spalding allowed for game flexibility with two constants: a larger ball than baseball as well as underhand pitching. In 1926, Walter Hakanson proposed unifying the disparate versions of the game into one, under a single name: Softball.",When was baseball invented?,2,"Baseball was invented in the mid-19th century, with the exact origins traced back to the 1830s or 1840s."

Two teams of nine players aim to score the most runs by striking a ball and running round a sequence of bases to reach the home plate.

The teams rotate between batting and fielding, with each session called an inning, and switch when the fielding team gets three opposition players out.

The pitcher throws the ball from a mound toward the catcher which the batter attempts to hit and get around the bases to the home plate.

Softball is similar but features 9 or 10 players per team, depending on the style being played. The basic rules are the same.",How does a player score a run in baseball or softball?,5,A player scores a run in baseball or softball by successfully touching all four bases in order and returning to home plate before the defensive team can make three outs.

A baseball game lasts for nine innings, while softball lasts for seven innings. There are three outs per half-inning (teams rotate batting and fielding each half-inning). Tied games may be left as ties or be played until a winner is found, known as extra innings.

Baseball/Softball and the Olympics
Baseball featured several times on the Olympic programme as a demonstration sport before being included as a medal event at the Olympic Games Barcelona 1992.

Cuba won the gold medal on the sport’s competitive debut and three times in total before it was removed from the programme following the Olympic Games Beijing 2008.

Softball was introduced at the Olympic Games Atlanta 1996 as a women-only medal sport, with the United States winning the sport’s inaugural gold medal. They won the subsequent two titles and enjoyed a 22-game winning streak from September 2000 before they were beaten by Japan in the final in 2008.

The park competition takes place on a varied course combining bowls and numerous bends, which the athletes use to gather speed and perform tricks mid-air.

The skateboarders are judged by the height and speed of the tricks they carry out during jumps, as well as their capacity to use the entire surface and all obstacles. They perform three 45‑second runs, with the best of three counting as their final round score.

Street events take place on a straight ‘street-like’ course with stairs, handrails, etc. set up to resemble the urban environments where skateboarding started out.

Modern pentathlon is made up of four events combining five sports:

- Riding, with a show jumping course on an unfamiliar horse that the athlete is allocated in a draw just 20 minutes before they compete.
- Fencing, which is split into two rounds: a ranking round where each athlete competes against each other athlete in a bout lasting one minute or until the first hit, and a second round based on the results of the first round. The format of the second round is single elimination, with each bout lasting 45 seconds. Points are scored for winning each bout.
- Swimming, with a 200m freestyle event.
- Running and shooting, with a laser-run where athletes alternate between running and shooting at five targets from a distance of 10m.
The modern pentathlon is divided into two sections. Firstly, athletes score points according to how they rank in the fencing, riding and swimming events, which decide their starting position for the laser run event. Secondly, during the laser-run, athletes start with a delay corresponding to the number of points between them and the leader. The first athlete to cross the finish line in the laser-run wins the gold medal.
